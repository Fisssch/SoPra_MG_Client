# Contributions

Every member has to complete at least 2 meaningful tasks per week, where a
single development task should have a granularity of 0.5-1 day. The completed
tasks have to be shown in the weekly TA meetings. You have one "Joker" to miss
one weekly TA meeting and another "Joker" to once skip continuous progress over
the remaining weeks of the course. Please note that you cannot make up for
"missed" continuous progress, but you can "work ahead" by completing twice the
amount of work in one week to skip progress on a subsequent week without using
your "Joker". Please communicate your planning **ahead of time**.

Note: If a team member fails to show continuous progress after using their
Joker, they will individually fail the overall course (unless there is a valid
reason).

**You MUST**:

- Have two meaningful contributions per week.

**You CAN**:

- Have more than one commit per contribution.
- Have more than two contributions per week.
- Link issues to contributions descriptions for better traceability.

**You CANNOT**:

- Link the same commit more than once.
- Use a commit authored by another GitHub user.

|  **[Helinton Philip Pathmarajah](https://github.com/Helinton-Philip-Pathmarajah)** | 03.04.25 | [Commit 1](https://github.com/Fisssch/SoPra_MG_Client/commit/272c5b24d1b228c438420f55b82067f5b56b095b) | If you want to change your password it is now not visible anymore so that you have a certain security factor, as well as in the userser profile page you can now see also the username. In the overview page of all users you now have a button that brings you back to the main page, also in the stats page. | Passowrd change is important for the security. The username, which is now visible is important that the user knows that he/she is on his profile. The back home button is imortant because some peple will not press the arrow back button in the top left corner of the browser. |
|                    | 03.04.25 | [Commit 2](https://github.com/Fisssch/SoPra_MG_Client/commit/d5ed7f0ff872a448b121565260e85a4d3af6573d) | Almost finished the hole logic and design with the lobby in the frontend. If you press join in the mainpage the correct informations will be send to the backend and a lobby will be created and the user will get his role, his team and also his ready status will be set to false (not ready). The Role and the Team will be shown in the lobbypage. There you will see the role of the player as well as the team clearly. You will also see the team color in the background. Then you also have a ready button which if you click on it will set the readystatus of the player to true (ready). You also have a button where you can change the role of the player and the team of the player. Those buttons can only be clicked if the player isn't ready. If the player is ready then you can not change the role or the team. If all players are ready & at least 4 players in the lobby then the players will be sent to the game page automatically. | This is important because you can not just start a game. You first need players then you also need to know if all the players are ready to play. And of course you want to give the player the option to choose a team or role. So basically said it is important because every multiplayer game needs a lobby. |
